            Genetic analysis and comparison of modern mangoes with Paleocene mango leaf fossils found near Damalgiri, Meghalaya indicate that the center of origin of the mango genus was in Indian subcontinent prior to joining of the Indian and Asian continental plates, some 60 million years ago. Mangoes were cultivated in India possibly as early as 2000 BCE. Mango was brought to East Asia around 400â€“500 BCE, was available by the 14th century on the Swahili Coast, and was brought in the 15th century to the Philippines, and in the 16th century to Brazil by Portuguese explorers.

            Mango is mentioned by Hendrik van Rheede, the Dutch commander of the Malabar region in his 1678 book, Hortus Malabaricus, about plants having economic value. When mangoes were first imported to the American colonies in the 17th century, they had to be pickled because of lack of refrigeration. Other fruits were also pickled and came to be called "mangoes", especially bell peppers, and in the 18th century, the word "mango" became a verb meaning "to pickle".

            The mango is considered an evolutionary anachronism, whereby seed dispersal was once accomplished by a now-extinct evolutionary forager, such as a megafauna mammal.
