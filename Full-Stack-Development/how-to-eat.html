            Make sure the mango is ripe.<br>
            If you push your fingers into it and they leave a dent, then the mango is ready to eat. Use the same method as you would to tell if an avocado or pear is ripe.
            <ul>
                <li>If you touch the mango and it remains firm, then leave it out for a few days until it's ready. If you eat a mango that isn't ripe, it'll taste hard and bitter, and you don't want to waste a good mango, especially because they can get expensive.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Wash the mango.<br>
            The mango should be clean even if you plan on peeling the skin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gather materials.<br>
            To cube or slice your mango, you'll need a knife, a cutting board, and a bowl for your mango cubes or slices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slice the mango.<br>
            Before you slice a mango, be aware that it has a large pit the shape of a giant almond in the center. Slice the mango as you would an apple, but take care to avoid the pit. Cut wedges into the mango that are no more than an inch thick.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Once you're done slicing, you should have several slices of mango with the skin still on, and a pit that still has some skin on it. Here's what to do next:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you just want to eat the mango, pick up the slices by the skin and eat them. You can try to eat some of the looser skin around the pit, but don't eat the skin too close to the pit because it can be stubborn and will get stuck in your teeth worse than corn-on-the-cob.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you want to peel the mango, you can pick up the slices by the skin and gently scoop them out with a spoon. If the pieces aren't ripe enough for that, use a knife.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </p>
