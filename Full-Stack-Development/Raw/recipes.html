            Making Mango Kesari
        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Now in a sauce pan, take 1.5 cups water and begin to heat it.</li>
            <li>In another pan or kadai, take 3 tablespoons ghee and let it melt.</li>
            <li>Keep the flame to low or medium-low and then add ½ cup fine rava (sooji).</li>
            <li>Also add 12 to 14 cashews.</li>
            <li>Roast the sooji in the ghee on a low to medium-low flame stirring often.</li>
            <li>The sooji has to be roasted well and should become aromatic. This is an important step and if the sooji is not roasted well, the halwa will become sticky or lumpy.</li>
            <li>By the time the rava is roasted, the cashews will also become light golden. </li>
            <li>Once the rava is roasted well then it will become aromatic and its color will also change. The rava grains start to look dry, separate and crisp. The ghee will also start separating.</li>
            <li>Meantime the water will also start boiling.</li>
            <li>Once the rava is roasted, then add the mango puree to it and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the boiling hot water in a slow stream. Be careful as the mixture splutters.</li>
            <li>As soon as you add the hot water, quickly begin to stir the halwa, so that lumps are not formed. For best results use a wired whisk while stirring.</li>
            <li>You will see that the sooji absorbs water and the halwa begin to thicken.</li>
            <li>After stirring, cover the pan with a lid and on a low flame simmer the halwa for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>All the water will be absorbed and the kesari will be done. If you want you can add some more ghee at this step.</li>
            <li>Serve mango rava kesari hot or warm or at room temperature. You can also take the mango kesari in small bowls or muffin cups. </li>
            <li>Once they become warm or cool, then remove them. Refrigerate the remaining mango kesari.</li>
